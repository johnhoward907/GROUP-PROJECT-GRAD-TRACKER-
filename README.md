## **PROJECT PROPOSAL**
### ***INTRODUCTION***
The JSX Masters Grade Tracker is a web-based, single-page React application platform designed to
simplify grade tracking for trainers as well as provide clear, personalised insights into student’s
academic progress. It will offer a seamless interface for trainers to manage grade records and for
students to view their individual results. It will result is a clean, simple, responsive and user-friendly
tool to serve both users seamlessly.

### ***GOALS AND OBJECTIVES***
### *Goal*
Develop a responsive, single-page web application for tracking and managing student grades with secure, role-based access for trainers and students.


### *Objectives*
1. UI: Design a clean, user-friendly interface that works seamlessly across all devices and screen sizes.

2. Grade Record Management: Allow trainers to add, edit, delete, and view student grade records; calculate student averages; and efficiently search, filter, and sort records by name, subject, level, or grade.

3. Student Access: Provide students with secure, read-only access to view their personal grades and averages, with filtering and sorting options by subject or category.

4. Authentication & Role-Based Access: Implement secure login and logout, with dynamic views based on user role—full management access for trainers and restricted access for students.

5. Application Structure: Build the app as a Single Page Application (SPA) with dynamic component rendering based on authentication and user roles for a smooth and interactive experience.

### ***TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES***
+ REACT
+ JSX
+ CSS
+ JSON-Server

### ***CHALLENGES***
1. Ensuring dynamic updates for both students and trainers while maintain separate views.
2. Managing data integrity when trainers can manipulate records and students can only view
their own.
3. Ensuring a smooth, uncluttered user experience with a clear role-based UI rendering on a
single page.
